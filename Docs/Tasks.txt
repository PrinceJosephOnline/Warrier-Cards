Create a simple WCF service
  No need for BLL, DAL, Entities
  Just the service layer, with a method that deals with dummy data
  One method that returns - image + price, accepts criteria (Color, LP, HP, Religion ) + index
  Dedicated end point for images

Create a simple MVC website
  - a master page - search bar
  - a home page - carousel display + latest/popular items display + filter panel


--Note: loading image, use a different service, dont't send the image with search results, load images on a separate asynch call
-- will go for pagination & lazy loading
